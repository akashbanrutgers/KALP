KALP protein with 19 amino acid residues is used to generate a negative mismatch with a DPPC Lipid bilayer
Run the Matlab file - Bilayerthickness_Loop_inner_19 and Bilayerthickness_Loop_inner_19

This file will execute all the other dependent Matlab files.

The DPPC bilayer and KALP 19 protein would be required as input.

The code will mesh the bilayer and dump an average height for each mesh box.

The difference of the values in the upper and lower monolayer will determine the thickness of the Lipid Bilayer.
