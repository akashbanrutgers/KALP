KALP protein with 23 amino acid residues is used to generate a perfact match condition with a DPPC Bilayer.
Run the Matlab file - Bilayerthickness_Loop_inner_27 and Bilayerthickness_Loop_inner_27

This file will execute all the other dependent Matlab files.

The DPPC bilayer and KALP 23 protein would be required as input.

The code will mesh the bilayer and dump an average height for each mesh box. 

The difference of the values in the upper and lower monolayer will determine the thickness of the Lipid Bilayer.
